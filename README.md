# Amicable-Numbers #

Ruby application that generates pairs of amicable numbers

## What are amicable numbers? ##

Two numbers **x** and **y** are amicable if the sum of the factors **x** equal **y** and the sum of the factors **y** equal **x**

#### Example: ####
```
The factors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, 110 and 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 11 + 20 + 22 + 44 + 55 + 110 = 284
The factors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71, 142 and 1 + 2 + 4 + 71 + 142 = 220
Therefore, 220 and 284 are a pair of amicable numbers!
